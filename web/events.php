		<h3>TechQuest</h3>
		<p>One day long event for TUKE students in Jedlíkova Student Dormitories, where partner companies prepare different short tasks for students to complete, such as finding bugs in code, quizzes, and logical tasks.

		<h3>BEST Course</h3>
		<p>10-14 day long event for 20-25 TUKE students and students from technical universities from all 85 Local BEST Groups from all over Europe. It consists of an academic part led by TUKE lecturers or partner company representatives focused on a specific topic (such as programming in Java language, 3D printing, Internet of Things…) where participants learn and present their results at the end of the course. During the non-academic part of a BEST Course, we show participants Kosice and Slovak culture, monuments, historical places, and traditions.</p>

	<div class="event_text"><h3>Workshops with partner companies</h3>
		<p>These are our most frequent events. Connecting TUKE students with companies is one of our primary goals to help them with career prospects. We organise short events with partner companies in the form of workshops at TUKE, or Open Days in company offices. They usually include a part dedicated to hard-skills or soft-skills, such as “How to write a good CV” or “Coding in different programming languages”. Companies have a chance to also present themselves to the students, collect students’ CVs, and show them how work life in the company works.</p>
